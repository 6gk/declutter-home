* Dotfiles - Origin and History
Believe it or not, the origin of dotfiles is due to a bug in
src_sh[:exports code]{ls}[1]. Unix creators wanted src_sh[:exports code]{ls}
to hide . and .. but due to a bug in src_sh[:exports code]{ls}, it hid all
the files and directories starting with a dot. Many people exploited this
bug and it became a "feature".
** Side note
As a side note, in Plan 9, dotfiles were completely removed and replaced
by a sane lib directory in which every configuration file would be stored
akin to src_sh[:exports code]{~/.config}.


* Dotfiles exploitation
Be happy that you're living in 2019 because before freedesktop came along,
every software's configuration file would be a dotfile in the home directory.
As an example, take larswm[2]; it's configuration file is
src_sh[:export code]{~
